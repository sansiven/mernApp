This can be used as a starting phase for any kind of projects. This app provides a login and authentication mechanism for any web app.


Step 1: Setting up DB
- Here I have used mlab so there is a need to whitelist your ip so that you can connect to the database

Then go to Network Access and click on Add IP address  and add your current IP.

Step 2: Setting project folders

You can use git clone or download to setup this project on your pc and then run npm install

Get into the project root directory and then type
