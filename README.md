# mernApp
This can be used as a starting phase for any kind of projects. This app provides a login and authentication mechanism for any web app.


Step 1: Setting up DB
- Here I have used mlab so there is a need to whitelist your ip so that you can connect to the database
https://account.mongodb.com/account/login
Email: sansiventest@yopmail.com
Password: $0s1t@143

Then go to Network Access and click on Add IP address  and add your current IP.

Step 2: Setting project folders

You can use git clone or download to setup this project on your pc and then run npm install

Step 3: Run the project
Get into the project root directory and then type 
- "npm run dev" for the react/redux and node project 
- "npm run test" for unit tests
